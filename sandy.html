&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <big>The Drama Ministries Ensemble (DME) of Northwestern College, Orange City, Iowa, will <br>
perform stories from the Old Testament at Family of God Community Church, 90 Quarterline Rd. in <br>
Newaygo, on Sunday, March 1, at 6:30 p.m. A &#8220;Sloppy Joe&#8221; Supper will precede the event; serving <br>
begins at 5:30. Community members are invited to both the supper and free performance.<br>
      <br>
In addition to staging the tragedy of the first brothers, Cain and Abel, the DME actors will also <br>
perform more of the Old Testament&#8217;s most dramatic accounts such as the binding of Isaac by his father <br>
Abraham, the killing of Goliath, and Daniel&#8217;s survival of the fiery furnace. Each drama is scripted directly <br>
from Scripture. <br>
      <br>
The scripting and performance of the dramas is part of a larger worship drama effort called the <br>
Ancient Hebrew Drama Project, led by Northwestern theatre professor and DME director Jeff Barker and <br>
Dr. Tom Boogaart, professor of Old Testament studies at Western Theological Seminary in Holland, <br>
Mich. Barker and Boogaart are co-authoring a book tentatively titled &#8220;Sarah Laughs Again: The Rebirth <br>
of Ancient Biblical Drama.&#8221; The Old Testament story of Sarah&#8217;s skeptical, humorous response to <br>
becoming pregnant will also be performed by the Northwestern theatre company. <br>
      <br>
Northwestern&#8217;s DME theatre company has performed across the U.S. and in Japan and Ethiopia. <br>
Rated a top-10 Midwestern college by U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine, Northwestern provides an <br>
education committed to academic rigor and a Christian worldview. The theatre department offers <br>
programs in theatre, theatre and speech, Christian theatre ministries, and arts administration. <br>
